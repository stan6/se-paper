### Notes:
Use structure like because (1)..., (2), ...(3)

What you evaluate on? Table x illustrates/shows/represents/lists.... Why we select? Why we did not select for outlier?


Definition of the metrics for each RQ

Machine configuration: All experiments were conducted on a machine with Intel (R)
Core (TM) i7-8700 CPU @3.2 GHz and 32 GB RAM.

should not used
-significantly high (statistically significant)
-extremely, obviously (strong words)
-very (strong words)

### Notes:
Two structures
1. Overall workflow
- Similar to describing a figure in evaluation
Figure ... shows/presents the overall workflow. Our approach/ToolName consists of ....: ... Given x, y, ... produces/generates... Our approach/ToolN generates ... using x steps/ x phrases. In the first step/First, ..... Second,
- Use symbol to represent a frequently mentioned component (e.g., buggy app, version app 1, old version 1) $app_{buggy}$ $app_buggy$
- For each ... in list, ...
2. Algorithm
- Challenges: (1), (2) / First, Second, add citations
- It supports three types: (1) ..., (2), (3)
- tool/subject program/app use \texttt{}
- know the correct capitalization: GitHub
- It uses ...strategies. Specifically, ...
- Algorithm ...shows
.... (lines 1--2)
In lines 12--13, ...
